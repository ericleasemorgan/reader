And King Agamemnon answered," Nestor, if the Trojans are indeed fighting at the rear of our ships, and neither the wall nor the trench has served us-over which the Danaans toiled so hard, and which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet-I see it must be the will of Jove that the Achaeans should perish ingloriously here, far from Argos.	./cache/homer-iliad-850_14.txt	./txt/homer-iliad-850_14.txt
