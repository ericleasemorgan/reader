But Juno said to Minerva," Alas, daughter of aegisbearing Jove, unweariable, shall the Argives fly home to their own land over the broad sea, and leave Priam and the Trojans the glory of still keeping Helen, for whose sake so many of the Achaeans have died at Troy, far from their homes? Those who held the strong city of Mycenae, rich Corinth and Cleonae; Orneae, Araethyrea, and Licyon, where Adrastus reigned of old; Hyperesia, high Gonoessa, and Pellene; Aegium and all the coastland round about Helice; these sent a hundred ships under the command of King Agamemnon, son of Atreus.	./cache/homer-iliad-850_02.txt	./txt/homer-iliad-850_02.txt
