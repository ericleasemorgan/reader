She called the gods about her, and said," Look to it, you two, Neptune and Minerva, and consider how this shall be; Phoebus Apollo has been sending Aeneas clad in full armour to fight Achilles. Meanwhile Hector called upon the Trojans and declared that he would fight Achilles." Be not afraid, proud Trojans," said he," to face the son of Peleus; I could fight gods myself if the battle were one of words only, but they would be more than a match for me, if we had to use our spears.	./cache/homer-iliad-850_20.txt	./txt/homer-iliad-850_20.txt
