He knew me and said,' Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, why, poor man, have you left the light of day and come down to visit the dead in this sad place? "'This,' I answered,' must be as it may please heaven, but tell me and tell me and tell me true, I see my poor mother 's ghost close by us; she is sitting by the blood without saying a word, and though I am her own son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me, Sir, how I can make her know me.'	./cache/homer-odyssey-850_11.txt	./txt/homer-odyssey-850_11.txt
