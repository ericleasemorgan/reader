SELECT "not necessarily complete nor accurate. For example, some things";
SELECT "are published in the future, and some records have no dates at";
SELECT "all. Some things do not have a title nor an abstract. Actually,";
SELECT "in the big scheme of things, these are not huge issues. We are";
SELECT "not here to do bibliographics; we are here to do natural langauge";
SELECT "processing, and we do have the text. On the other hand, many of";
SELECT "the records do contain useful identifiers which can ultimately be";
SELECT "exploited to fill in the gaps.";
SELECT "";
SELECT "Another problem is there are no distinct keys. The metadata";
SELECT "includes a column named 'cord_uid', which is intended as a key,";
SELECT "but the values in the column are not unique. Consequently, we";
SELECT "have to create a key.";
SELECT "";
SELECT "But there is a more challenging problem. Some of the records";
SELECT "describe (point to) JSON files in a shape called 'pdf_json'.";
SELECT "Some of the records describe (point to) JSON files in a shape";
SELECT "called 'pmc_json'. Some (most) of the records describe (point";
SELECT "to) both types of JSON files. The challenge is, 'Which flavor of";
SELECT "JSON do we use to do our natural langauge processing against?'";
SELECT "";
SELECT "Finally, the metadata is/was delivered as a flat (CSV) file, when";
SELECT "the content is actually relational in nature. The best example is";
SELECT "the authors column; the authors column is really a semi-colon";
SELECT "delimited set of values which could be normalized into a separate";
SELECT "table. Doing so would enable us to count & tabulate author names";
