Summary of your 'study carrel'
==============================

This is a summary of your Distant Reader 'study carrel'.

The Distant Reader harvested & cached your content into a
collection/corpus. It then applied sets of natural language
processing and text mining against the collection. The results of
this process was reduced to a database file -- a 'study carrel'.
The study carrel can then be queried, thus bringing light
specific characteristics for your collection. These
characteristics can help you summarize the collection as well as
enumerate things you might want to investigate more closely.
