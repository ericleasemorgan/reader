# Contributing to Distant Reader

We welcome contributions from everyone.
We use the following online resources to track work:

* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ericleasemorgan/reader/projects/2?card_filter_query=label%3Acovid-19)
  in this project to track day-to-day tasks.
* The slack channel [distantreader.slack.com](). Everyone is welcome [to join](http://bit.ly/distantreader-on-slack).

We have weekly meetings, open by invitation. Please reach out and we will be
happy to include you!

Our workflow is to create or choose an issue in the project's issue tracker.
Assign it to yourself, or leave a comment that you are interested in working on
it. Submit a pull request when you are done. If you have questions or problems,
please get in touch either via an issue or on Slack.
